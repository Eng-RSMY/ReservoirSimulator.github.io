title: Providing free answer about reservoir simulation
---
We are glad to answer the technical questions about reservoir simulation, if:
+ it is only about thermal or compositional reservoir simulation, not black oil;
+ the model is small(such as the grid number is less than 10K), because we haven't high performance computer to run large model;
+ your model can be uploaded to GitHub publicly and can be shared by others;

If you agree with it, please send your model and questions to peclouds@hotmail.com , we will try to give our analysis and suggestion.

Please be patient, because we can only use the part time to answer questions :-)
